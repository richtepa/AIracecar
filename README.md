Creating a neural network from scratch.

Optimization of the neurons is done by reproduction / survival of the fittest.

## Training

Demo of the training environment:
https://richtepa.github.io/AIracecar/trainer/index.html

UI is only basic, WIP:
* Generation, #NN, amount of NNs in generation and most checkpoints or fastest time (top left corner)
* Acceleration and direction (bottom left corner)
* Play/Pause (red square, bottom right corner)

## Node Inspector

Demo of the node inspector:

UI is only basic, WIP:
* Use slider to eliminate connections with a lower absolute weight
* Click and hold module to filter for connected nodes to the selected one
